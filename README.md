Weird synth etc

My aim is to start out by successfully playing multiple notes (at once)
using the code from tonegenerator (Cockos)

Then I want to substitute my own code (from sonicstack) so I can put my weird synth into Reaper.

Then I want to rewind a few years to another project where I modelled vibrations rather than just
generating weird waves.
